# LocationMate

### A hassle-free way to find your friends!

LocationMate, as the name suggests, is an Android app to help find the location of your friends within a Wi-Fi-enabled campus. The app works by scanning the BSSID of the nearest access point and retrieving the respective location from a pre-populated BSSID-location database. LocationMate uses a cryptographic hash to add friends and also has privacy features for hiding your location.
